## Select a World
To navigate to the "Select a World" page, click on the **World** menu and select **Select a World.**

On this page, you will see a list of all of the directories inside your "World Directory." You can click on any of the links on the page to enter the world.

Each directory in your "World Directory" contains all of the files, resources, and data unique to that world. While you can edit files within this directory outside of the _Velox Mundi Desktop_ application, the file and folder structure should not be modified outside of the application.

If you don't see any worlds or want to <a href="#create-a-world">create a new world</a>.

## Create a world

To create a new world, click on the **File** menu and selecting the **New** submenu and clicking on the **World** page. You will be asked to provide a name for your new world. This name will be the directory name saved to your computer, so please make sure that you use acceptable characters for a folder on your computer.

Once the world has been created, you will see it listed on the **<a href="#select-a-world">Select a World</a>** page. You can click on the world's link to view the "<a href="#world-home">World Home</a>" page.

## World Home

The "World Home" page can be accessed at any time by clicking on the **World** menu and selecting the **World Home** option.

The "World Home" page will list all of the pages you have <a href="#create-a-page">created</a>. Click on any link to open an editor for that page.

## Create a Page

You can create a new page from the "World Home" or from any page editor by clicking on the **File** menu, selecting the **New** submenu, and clicking the **Page** option.

A new page editor will open. _Velox Mundi Desktop_ supports two styles of editors: Rich Text and Markdown. You can change your default page editor by selecting the **Tools** menu and selecting the **Options** link. A new "Options" window will open. Click on the link to the button labeled "Go to settings" in the "User Preferences" section. Change the "Editor Style" dropdown to your preferred editor style. This style will determine the editor that loads when you create a new page. Existing pages will be edited in the appropriate editor based on their file type.

## Edit a Page

Once you have created a new page or clicked on the link to an existing page, the page will be loaded into the appropriate editor (rich text or markdown) for that file type. Inside the editor, you can edit your page to add text, images, and links to other pages.

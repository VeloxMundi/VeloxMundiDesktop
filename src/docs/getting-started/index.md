The first time you run _Velox Mundi Desktop,_ you will be taken to the "Velox Mundi Setup" page. On this page, you will be prompted to select a "World Directory." This directory can be anywhere on your computer, and is the directory where all of your world data will be stored.

To set the "World Directory," simply click the button labeled "Select World Directory." This will open a dialog window you can use to select the local directory to store your world data.

You can create a new, blank directory, or use an existing Velox Mundi directory. Please be careful when using an existing directory, as _Velox Mundi Desktop_ will modify the directory's contents and structure to fit the application's needs.

Once you have selected your directory, click on the button labeled "Save Changes" to be taken to the "Select a world" page, where you can select an existing world or create a new world.

You can create as many worlds as you want to within the "World Directory" by following the instructions on the "<a href="../getting-started/world-navigation/#create-a-world">Create World</a>" page.

To change your base "World Directory" at any time, click on the **Tools** menu and select **Options.** This will open a new **options** window where you can change the application's settings, including the "World Directory."

In the new window, click the button labeled **Set Directory.** A dialog window will open asking you to select a folder where your world data is or will be stored. This folder can be located anywhere on your computer. _Velox Mundi Desktop_ will read and write files in this directory as you build your world.

Once you have selected a directory, you can close the **Options** window and begin working on building your worlds.
